# Lead Scoring Project

In response to X Education's need for a more efficient lead conversion process, this project aimed to develop a predictive lead scoring model. The primary objective was to identify high-potential leads and prioritize them for the sales team, ultimately improving the overall lead conversion process.

# Project Overview
The project involved the following key steps:

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted a comprehensive exploration of the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and understand the characteristics of leads.

# Feature Selection:
Employed techniques to select relevant features that contribute significantly to the predictive power of the model. This step aimed to enhance the efficiency of the model by focusing on the most impactful variables.

# Addressing Multicollinearity:
Dealt with multicollinearity issues, ensuring that the selected features are independent and do not introduce redundancy into the model. This step contributes to the stability and interpretability of the final model.

# Model Development:
Fine-tuned a decision tree model to achieve a recall of 0.8. The decision tree was chosen as the predictive model due to its interpretability and ability to capture non-linear relationships in the data.

# Key Achievements
Improved Lead Prioritization:
The developed predictive lead scoring model successfully identifies high-potential leads, enabling the sales team to focus their efforts on leads with a higher likelihood of conversion.

# Recall Optimization:
The decision tree model was fine-tuned to achieve a recall of 0.8, emphasizing the importance of capturing a high proportion of actual positive cases (potential conversions).
